# Angular Projects 🅰️

Collection of Angular web application projects showcasing different features and UI patterns.

This repository contains a set of Angular projects I’ve built to practice web development with Angular and experiment with real app ideas.

Each project is a standalone Angular application that demonstrates core concepts like component design, routing, forms, and interaction with APIs.

## Projects Included 📁

Inside this repository you’ll find multiple Angular projects, for example:

- affiliateweb 
- foodsite 
- showtime 
- webnews 

Consiglio: aggiungi per ciascun progetto una breve descrizione qui sotto indicando cosa fa e cosa dimostra (es. uso di routing, servizi, moduli, design responsive, ecc.).

## Tech Stack 📦

This collection uses the Angular framework and related tools:

- Angular (framework frontend)
- TypeScript
- HTML & CSS
- Angular CLI (for creating, building, and serving projects)
- Optional: additional libraries depending on each project

Angular promotes best practices such as modular code organization, components, and reactive programming patterns.

## Getting Started 🚀

To run any project locally:

- Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Wario-Ametrano/Angular-Projects.git
```
- Navigate to a specific project folder:
```
cd Angular-Projects/<project-name>
```
- Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```
- Run the dev server:
```
ng serve
```
- Open your browser at: http://localhost:4200

Repeat for each Angular project in the repository.

## What You Can Learn 🎯

This repository helps you explore real Angular basics and intermediate skills:

- Angular application structure
- Component and module design
- Routing and navigation
- User interfaces and responsive layout
- Forms and data binding
- TypeScript usage in frontend
Angular encourages specific coding conventions and patterns that improve readability and maintainability.

## Tips 💡

- Use Angular CLI to experiment with new features and components.
- Organize shared logic into modules for reuse.
- Try deploying one of the projects to GitHub Pages or Vercel for live demos.
